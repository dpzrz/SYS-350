- Connect new adapters for those networks to your **pfSense firewall**  
- Select appropriate subnet/network addresses for those networks and assign IPs to the pfSense interfaces  
- Reference **M1** where we created our initial **SYS350 LAN** network  

---

## 2. Create a New VM: `web01-yourname`
- Place on **DMZ network**  
- Configure appropriate IP addresses/settings  
- Install a web service (e.g., Apache or NGINX)  
- Create a simple web page on each with:  
  - your name  
  - server name  

---

## 3. Create a New Ubuntu Server: `Backup01-yourname`
- Place on **MGMT network**  
- Configure appropriate IP addresses/settings  

---

## 4. Configure Firewall Settings
- Allow your new **DMZ** and **MGMT** networks to access the Internet  
- Allow **MGMT** and **LAN** to access **DMZ**  
- **But not vice versa!** (DMZ should not be able to initiate connections to MGMT and LAN)  
- Allow **web (80,443)** from anywhere to **DMZ**

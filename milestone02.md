Deliverable 4. Capture this process in your tech journal. There is a great deal of work here. Make sure you capture what was done technically to meet the requirements of this milestone. If you've documented relevant AD configurations before, you can link to that documentation with annotations on any substantive changes. Most of the AD steps were fully documented in classes such as SYS265. Make sure to capture and comment on the areas that gave you trouble. Provide links to the documentation you created in the course of this milestone. Share your repos w/ rtgillen on github
